# Joe's code notebooks

This is where I keep track of my computational notebooks. Theses are meant to be programs that explain as well as execute. 

## Table of Contents

## Installation

I will add a script to create a python environemnt and an R environment at some point soon
#### Building the python environment
Run these commands 
```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Usage

I will write a short abstract for each notebook here 


## License
These are for spreading knowledge. So at some point I'll add the GPLv3 license.
