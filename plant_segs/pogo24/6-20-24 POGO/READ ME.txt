Plots 35 (Orange) & 36 (Yellow) POGO Images. Very sunny day, some clouds covering periodically. With 4:3, 9mp zoomed option, we tested different shutter speeds to see what works best in the light/shawdows. Anything below 1/1250 is too "bleached" of an image. While anything above 1/2500 is too dark. We found that images taken with 1/2000 can be too dark with shawdows near the braceroots, esepcailly when more shawdows are casted due to being below the canopy. Test using 1/1250 - 1/1600 from now on and determine what is best in shawdows as plants grow more.
