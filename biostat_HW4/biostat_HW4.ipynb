    "### Question #1\n",
    "An experiment was conducted at the University of California–Berkeley to study the psychological environment e¤ect on the anatomy of the brain. A group of 19 rats was randomly divided into two groups. Twelve animals in the treatment group lived together in a large cage, furnished with playthings that were changed daily, while animals in the control group lived in isolation with no toys. After a month the experimental animals were killed and dissected. Table Q1 gives the cortex weights (the thinking part of the brain) in milligrams. Use the two-sample t test to compare the means of the two groups and draw appropriate conclusions. State clearly your null and alternative hypotheses and choice of test size (significant level) and p-value.\n"
