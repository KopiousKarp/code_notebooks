    "# Experimentation with other Edge Detection Techniques\n",

    "The purpose of this notebook is to experiment with Edge detection operators and supporting algorithms that I may have overlooked. \n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, The [best that I have to offer](./plantCV_notebook.ipynb) is based on the 3x3 Sobel operator that calculates the first derivative of the image. \n",
    "\n",
    "But after [reading more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canny_edge_detector) it occurs to me that I might have made premature conclusions on what is the \"cutting edge\" of edge detection based image segmentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook hopes to be a more comprehensive approach."
