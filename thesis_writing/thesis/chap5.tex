\chapter{Discussion \& Conclusion}
% Goal: Just a page "or whatever"

% Discussion section discusses the paths to improving the project. Building towards a ViT. Building the dataset. What is the path to the bleeding edge? 
%Here is a possible narrative. Showing off the transcriptomic analysis which then justifies the Phenomic process. 
% But what is the logic? MUTANT STUDIES AND STRUCTURAL STUDIES show the need for phenomics. But how do I justify MY phenotypes. Talk to Than, he presented a poster at MGM. ASK FOR HIS DATA!!! 

I would love to discuss, but I need to spend more time coding first.
