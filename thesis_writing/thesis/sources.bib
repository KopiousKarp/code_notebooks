  abstract  = "The human reference genome represents only a small number of
               individuals, which limits its usefulness for genotyping. We
               present a method named HISAT2 (hierarchical indexing for spliced
               alignment of transcripts 2) that can align both DNA and RNA
               sequences using a graph Ferragina Manzini index. We use HISAT2
               to represent and search an expanded model of the human reference
               genome in which over 14.5 million genomic variants in
               combination with haplotypes are incorporated into the data
               structure used for searching and alignment. We benchmark HISAT2
               using simulated and real datasets to demonstrate that our
               strategy of representing a population of genomes, together with
               a fast, memory-efficient search algorithm, provides more
               detailed and accurate variant analyses than other methods. We
               apply HISAT2 for HLA typing and DNA fingerprinting; both
               applications form part of the HISAT-genotype software that
               enables analysis of haplotype-resolved genes or genomic regions.
               HISAT-genotype outperforms other computational methods and
               matches or exceeds the performance of laboratory-based assays.",
